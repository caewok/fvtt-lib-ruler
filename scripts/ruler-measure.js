/* 
The original measure code seems inefficient b/c it:
	1. loops over each waypoint
	2. measures the resulting segments, which requires looping over each segment.
	3. loops over the resulting distances
	4. loops over the segments to draw them
	5. loops over the waypoints to draw endpoints
	
canvas.grid.measureDistances uses map over the segments in the default, 
as does the overwritten dnd5e version. I know of no method that requires 
knowing all the segments in advance. It seems unlikely, because a segment is
conceptually discrete and determined by the user on the fly. 

For a ruler, knowing the prior segments may be important to determine distance to 
date, but knowing the end segments is less likely to matter. Keep in mind that the
ruler always starts with a single segment, and is built up or destroyed by the user;
we never really know at this stage what the final destination is.

So this code has been revised to rely on a single loop. Each segment is built up in 
that loop, and sub-functions are told what segment number we are on and are provided
the segments built thus far. Beside that information, sub-functions have access to the 
ruler object (via this) and can access the original waypoints array and any module flags.
