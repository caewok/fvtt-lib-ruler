// Segments are chained: each Segment contains a previous_segments Array 
// that should include each of the earlier segments in the Ruler path

/*
Possible movements / representation of a measured path:

(1) modifies the represented physical path 
  (does not modify the ruler display but symbolizes how in fact the token moves in space)
  - elevate into 3-D space (or more dimensions, why not!)
  - approximate a curve or other linear path that may or may not be 2-D
  - interjects something non-linear, like stumbling or teleport, into the path 
    (probably would require a different measure function to accommodate multiple segments,
      or would require interjecting segments into the segments Array in some manner)
  - physically deviate the 2-D path from what is represented by the ruler    
(2) modifies rules for measuring distance
   - e.g., dnd5e measure functions (5-5-5, 5-10-5, Euclidean) 
     (built-in to canvas.grid.measureDistances but otherwise would require a function)
   - possibly some curve approximations (like assuming the ruler represents a thrown object 
     along a parabola)
   - handle modifications from (1), such as projecting 3-D to a 2-D canvas  
(3) increases the cost of the distance amount but not really the path per se
  - multiplier for part or all of a path
  - adder for part or all of a path
  - zero out some or all of the distance cost
- ?

Call a function to get the physical path for a segment for (1).
Call a specified measurement function for (2). 
Apply modifiers in sequence for (3) after measuring the distance.
