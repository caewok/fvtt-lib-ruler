# Installation

## Dependencies

- [libWrapper Module](https://github.com/ruipin/fvtt-lib-wrapper)

## As a Module
1.  Copy this link and use it in Foundry's Module Manager to install the Module.

    > https://github.com/caewok/fvtt-lib-ruler/releases/latest/download/module.json

2.  Enable the Module in your World's Module Settings.

## As a Library
Your options parallel that of [libWrapper](https://github.com/ruipin/fvtt-lib-wrapper#122-as-a-library). Those options are shamelessly copied and adapted here:
1. Adapt the shim provided by libWrapper [shim](#134-compatibility-shim).
<!--- May eventually want to provide our own --->

2. Write your own. **Please do not make your custom shim available in the global scope.**

3.  Trigger a different code path depending on whether libRuler is installed and active or not. For example:

    ```javascript
    Hooks.once('libRulerReady', async function() {
     // FLAG ANYTHING YOU NEED GIVEN THAT LIBRULER IS ACTIVE
    }
    
    // or 
    
    if(game.modules.get('lib-ruler')?.active) {
     // DO LIB-RULER VERSION
    }
    
    ```

    or 


4.  Require your users to install this library. One simple example that achieves this is provided below. Reference the more complex example in the provided [shim](#134-compatibility-shim) if you prefer a dialog (including an option to dismiss it permanently) instead of a simple notification.

    ```javascript
    Hooks.once('ready', () => {
        if(!game.modules.get('lib-ruler')?.active && game.user.isGM)
            ui.notifications.error("Module XYZ requires the 'libRuler' module. Please install and activate this dependency.");
    });
    ```

    Note that if you choose this option and require the user to install this library, you should make sure to list libRuler as a dependency. This can be done by adding the following to your package's manifest:

    ```javascript
    "dependencies": [
        {
            "name": "lib-ruler"
        }
    ]
    ```

# Usage

The libRuler module overrides two functions of the Ruler Class: `Ruler.prototype.measure` and `Ruler.prototype.moveToken.` In doing so, the libRuler module deprecates `Ruler.prototype._highlightMeasurement` in favor of a nearly identical version of that function in a new `Segment` class. In order to track changed Ruler properties across users, libRuler wraps `Ruler.prototype.toJSON` and `Ruler.prototype.update`. All of these changes are implemented using the [libWrapper](https://github.com/ruipin/fvtt-lib-wrapper) module.

## How to use libRuler

The expectation is that modules will use [libWrapper](https://github.com/ruipin/fvtt-lib-wrapper) to wrap one or more functions in the `Segment` Class. The `Segment` Class is exposed at `window.libRuler.Segment` and can be wrapped similarly to wrapping core Foundry methods, for example:

```javascript
libWrapper.register(MODULE_ID, 'window.libRuler.Segment.prototype.addProperties', [COOL FUNCTION HERE], 'WRAPPER');
 ```
 
[Elevation Ruler](https://github.com/caewok/fvtt-elevation-ruler) has several examples of wrapping libRuler functions.

## Changes to `Ruler.prototype.measure`

libRuler's version of `Ruler.prototype.measure`, at [measure.js](https://github.com/caewok/fvtt-lib-ruler/blob/master/scripts/ruler-measure.js) now creates a `Segment` representing the path between two waypoints (including origin or destination, as appropriate). The sequence of events remains the same, but events are now mostly handled by the `Segment` Class. This permits modules to wrap or otherwise modify sub-parts of the Ruler measurement flow without having to re-write the entire measure method. The now-extensible parts, in the order encountered during measuring:
1. `Ruler.setDestination` is a new function that simply identifies and sets the `PIXI.Point` destination for the ruler.

For each segment in turn, from the origin outward:

2. A new `Segment` is created. See `Segment` Class below for more details.
3. `Segment.drawLine` draws the ruler line on the canvas.
4. `Segment.drawDistanceLabel` draws the text label indicating the ruler distance.
5. `Segment.highlightMeasurement` highlights grid spaces on the canvas.
6. `Segment.drawEndpoints` handles drawing the origin, destination, and waypoint indicators. 

## `Segment` Class

Most modules will want to wrap functions for the [new `Segment` Class](https://github.com/caewok/fvtt-lib-ruler/blob/master/scripts/segment.js). A Segment contains a link to the Ruler Class, a link to the prior segment in the chain, if any. Properties include:
- `prior_segment`: The previous `Segment` or {} where this is the first segment originating from the measured start point.
- `segment_num`: Number of the segment, where 0 is the first segment originating from the measured start point.
- `ruler`: Ruler for this segment.
- `ray`: Ray representing the segment line.
- `label`: Ruler label corresponding to the segment.
- `color`: Color associated with the segment.
- `options`: Options currently limited to whether to use gridSpaces when measuring distance.

### `Segment.constructRay` method

Method to create a Ray used to represent the ruler line on the canvas. 

### `Segment.measureDistance` and how distance calculation works

One big change from the Foundry core is how libRuler permits modules to build upon one another for calculating distance. This is accomplished in the `Segment.measureDistance` method. It is expected that most methods will not override this method but instead will wrap one or more of its sub-functions. 

Measuring distance is done in three stages. 
1. `Segment.constructPhysicalPath`. A physical path is constructed, building up an array of points representing the path along the segment. By default, this physical path is comprised of two 2-D points: origin and destination of the segment. 
2. `Segment.distanceFunction`. A distance calculator method is called to convert the physical path into a numeric value. If a module wraps (1), it likely will need to wrap (2) as well. 
3. `Segment.getDistanceModifiers`. A set of modifier strings are applied to the numeric distance value. This typically should look like "+5" or "*2". An arbitrary number of modifiers can be applied, in the order they appear in the Array that stores them.

[Elevation Ruler](https://github.com/caewok/fvtt-elevation-ruler/blob/develop/scripts/segment.js), for example, wraps `Segment.constructPhysicalPath` (1) to create a 3-D physical path by adding the z-dimension to each point. Elevation Ruler then wraps `Segment.distanceFunction` (2) in order to project the 3-D path back onto the 2-D canvas, where the underlying distance measurement function takes over. 

### `Segment.distance` getter and `Segment.recalculateDistance` method

Probably need not be modified by modules; this retrieves the calculated distance of a segment, forcing a re-calculation if no value is yet present. Some modules may want to force a call to `recalculateDistance`.

### `Segment.totalPriorDistance` and `Segment.totalDistance` getters

`Segment.totalPriorDistance` returns the calculated distance of the preceding segments; `Segment.totalDistance` adds in the distance of the current segment

### `Segment.text` getter

Modules looking to modify the text label of a ruler should wrap this getter. 

### `Segment.traversePriorSegments` helper method

Modules may use this method to traverse the links of prior segments. Note that in many cases, it is sufficient to set a flag and then update or read that flag from the immediate prior segment, negating the need for a full traversal. 

### `Segment.addProperties` method and Segment Flags

The `Segment` class adds the same `getFlag`, `setFlag`, `unsetFlag` used elsewhere in Foundry. This allows modules to add arbitrary properties to each segment without naming conflicts. When creating a new Segment, the `constructor` method calls `Segment.addProperties`, which gives modules a chance to add flags or do other tasks prior to distance calculation or drawing of the segment. 

### `Segment.highlightMeasurement` and subfunctions `Segment.highlightPosition` and `Segment.colorForPosition`

libRuler moves `Ruler._highlightMeasurement` to the Segment class. The underlying code is nearly the same. The primary change is that `Segment.highlightPosition` is called, giving modules an opportunity to change how a give Segment or sub-segment is highlighted on the canvas. This sub-function, in turn, calls `Segment.colorForPosition`. Modules interested in changing highlighting or highlighted color should look here. 

## Changes to `Ruler.prototype.moveToken`

The code for moving a token using the ruler remains nearly the same as in core. Ruler Class gains a `testForCollision` method to confirm whether a collision has in fact occurred, and an `animateToken` method to actually do the token movement.

This allows [Elevation Ruler](https://github.com/caewok/fvtt-elevation-ruler/blob/develop/scripts/ruler.js), for example, to add elevation to the token as it is moved along the ruler path.

## Ruler Flags

libRuler adds the same `getFlag`, `setFlag`, `unsetFlag` used elsewhere in Foundry to the Ruler Class. This allows modules to add arbitrary properties to each Ruler without naming conflicts.
